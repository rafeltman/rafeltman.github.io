<p>Summer in the city might send some of us running for the air conditioning, but sometimes the concret jungle can feel a little too concrete and decidedly un-jungle-like. What's a worker bee to do?</p><br><br>

<p>Luckily, the city of New York has really stepped up the number of public wi-fi hotspots. And where the city falls short, its businesses pick up the slack. Here are some of the top sweet spots for scoring an internet connection while enjoying one of the city's parks. Click the map for more info on each spot. </p>

<h1>Here are the best...</h1>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<ol>
<h2><li> <a href="http://www.centralparknyc.org/visit/things-to-see/north-end/charles-a-dana-discovery-center.html">Central Park</a></li> </h2>
<br>
<p>Central Park gets our top spot for the sheer number of options you'll have if you work there: In addition to the year-round hotspots at the Zoo, the Mineral Springs Pavilion, and the Charles A. Dana Discovery Center, during the summer you can snag a signal by the SummerStage theater near Rumsey Playfield. Wifi is spotty at best throughout most of the park , but we found that setting up shop as close as possible to the source gave a decent signal. The hotspot up at the Charles A. Dana Center gets extra points for having the least tourist traffic.</p>
<br><br>
<h2><li> <a href="http://www.washingtonmarketpark.org/">Washington Market Park</a></li></h2>
<br>
<p>This is a work space for people who want to enjoy a steady buzz of people, including kids running through the provided sprinklers. The picturesque gazebo is where you want to be, and the wifi signal is surprisingly strong. The only downside is that the park closes at dusk, but hey, you've got to go home eventually.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2><li> <a href="http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/batterypark">Battery Park</a></li></h2>
<br>
<p>The massive (25 acre!) Battery Park offers stunning views of the Statue of Liberty and the Freedom Towers. It's also got some decent wifi, but only if you know where to look: the Bosque area, which features a nature conservancy and a gorgeous fountain, and the Ferry Landing. We recommend the Bosque area, which has some good seating, but both locations can get a little wet if you're not careful.</p><br><br>
<h2><li> <a href="http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/tompkinssquarepark">Tompkins Square Park</a></li></h2>
<br><br>
<p>The park: Scenic, peaceful, and full of the energy of Alphabet City and its residents. The wifi: Strongest near the bathrooms. Sad, but true. On the plus side, they seem to be well-maintained, and we got our work done without noticing any unpleasant aromas</p>
<br><br>
<h2><li> <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/marcus-garvey-park-new-york">Marcus Garvey Park</a></li></h2>
<br>
<p>This park is Harlem's hidden gem, and locals will tell you it's the best place in the city to spend a quiet afternoon in the summer. Much less foot traffic than most downtown parks, and has a solid wifi signal, especially near the amphitheater (not a bad place to work, since you can see the whole city from the top). The best part? There's a public library right across the street, so you can enjoy a little air conditioning without hurting your wallet or productivity.</p></ol>
