<h1>Pitches for Final Data Project</h1>
<br>
<h2>Calories Per Capita</h2>
<br>
In 2010, <a href="http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=n4ff2muj8bh2a_&ctype=l&strail=false&nselm=h&met_y=GDPP&fdim_y=scenario:1&scale_y=lin&ind_y=false&rdim=world&idim=country:US:CN:IN&idim=ungroup:219&tstart=1104537600000&tunit=Y&tlen=55&iconSize=0.5&uniSize=0.035#!ctype=m&strail=false&bcs=d&nselm=s&met_s=CLPC&fdim_s=scenario:1&scale_s=lin&ind_s=false&idim=country:US:CN:IN&ifdim=country:parent:world&pit=1276574400000&hl=en_US&dl=en_US&ind=false">each person in the United States had nearly 4,000 calories available to them in a day</a>. In Afghanistan, only 2,200. I'd like to create some visualization of what these dicrepencies in total food availability look like: Not a map, if I can help it, but some other manner of infographic I haven't learned how to make yet. This would be reminiscent of <a href="http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1626519,00.html">this photo essay</a>, and incorporate more data and conclusions about food scarcity in various countries. I would, of course, address the fact that high calorie availability per capita doesn't necessarily equal a lack of hunger.

<h2>Spots to Do Work in NYC</h2>
<br>
Where are <a href="https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Facilities-and-Structures/Map-of-Parks/jc79-4imn">the parks</a>? <a href="https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Media/Wifi-Hotspot-Locations/ehc4-fktp">Where are the wifi hotspots</a>? I'd like to overlay this data (and perhaps several other points) to find the locations of some ideal outdoor spots to work in during the summer. Would be a map with a list-type article featuring blurbs about each location.

<h2>What Makes a Neighborhood Good for Sidewalk Cafes?</h2>
<br>
Looking at <a href="https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Business-and-Economic/Sidewalk-Cafes/6k68-kc8u"data on sidwalk cafe location</a> and comparing it with average income, neighborhood congestion, noise complaints and crime, and so on.  This would probably be an article, but I could use a map as well.
